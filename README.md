### Arithmetic FormatterPassed

* **Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.**


Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:
```
  235
+  52
-----
```

**Optional feature :** The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers should be displayed.


### For example

Function Call:
```py
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])
```

Output:
```
   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
```

Function Call:
```py
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True)
```

Output:
```
  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
  40     -3800     19998      474
```


### Testing 

The tests for this project are in `test_module.py`. I imported the test from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.
